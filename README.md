# Jordan Graves 👋

**Multifamily Energy Consultant • NRPP-Certified Radon Pro • Compliance & Community Builder**

I'm streamlining multifamily ops: Energy modeling (eQUEST, IECC/EBEWE), radon testing (ANSI/AARST), and resident programs that boost NOI and retention. Scaling radon services across CA, TX, FL, and beyond. Side quest: Prototyping smart ring + AR interfaces.

> Ask me about QA/QC for 100+ unit sites or turning surveys into retention gold.

## What I'm Building
- PCNA/PCA templates & dashboards (Word/Python automation)
- Radon ops toolkit (SOPs, QA/QC calcs, device logs)
- Energy model starters (eQUEST archetypes for MF)
- Community feedback scripts (Typeform → insights)

## Tech Stack
- **Energy**: eQUEST, Energy Star PM, RETScreen
- **Data/Ops**: Python (pandas), Excel, Zapier
- **Design**: Figma, Canva

## Quick Wins
- Benchmarked 200+ units → $500K+ savings potential
- NRPP-certified; HUD radon testing for multifamily
- 50+ resident events → 15% satisfaction lift
